h2. Alternative TextMate Bundles

A collection of copies of the default .tmbundles commonly used by me, but with their uuid's changed.

This enables me to have access to the default TM setup, while still running my own complete setup, and with all the changes that I require. 

Sure, I can use TM's built-in handling for this (with .tmDelta's and so on), but I just prefer it like this. 

Anyway, this is all...

h2. WORK IN PROGRESS

...so don't get too excited just yet.


Oh, the website link above, that don't have anything either at this time. It will though, one fine day ;-)
