This is the TextMate Bundle for [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) SCSS Syntax. Using [SublimeText2?, click here!](https://github.com/kuroir/SCSS.tmbundle/tree/SublimeText2)

This bundle contains the grammar files for highlighting the NEW SYNTAX; the old syntax is not supported by this bundle. Sorry.

It also includes Zen CSS ( from the Zen Coding Project ); which will help you speed up your coding.


### Installation Instructions

    mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
    git clone git://github.com/kuroir/SCSS.tmbundle.git "SCSS.tmbundle"
    osascript -e 'tell app "TextMate" to reload bundles'

If you are using pre-release textmate2, the bundle should be installed in:

    mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/Avian/Bundles
    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Avian/Bundles
    git clone git://github.com/kuroir/SCSS.tmbundle.git "SCSS.tmbundle"

### Extra Features
#### New Feature: XHTML to SCSS Converter
You can see the new feature in action in [this screencast](http://screenr.com/TZ0). Sorry for my engrish.. I need to practice more heh.

Notes about this feature:

Yo shouldn't use this feature to convert the whole XHTML to SCSS. It is meant to selectively copy and paste your XHTML to SCSS Document. In the Screencast I did a complete layout parse for the sake of demonstration. However this is a bad practice since it generates unnecessary nesting and of course bloat.

#### New Feature: XHTML to SCSS Converter now uses style declarations!

See it in action! [Screencast](http://screenr.com/fP4).

#### The minimum requirements for this command to work:

- [Nokogiri](http://nokogiri.org/)
- Ruby 1.8.7 or higher (it comes by default with Snow Leopard)
- Mac OS X (No support for Windows yet. I didn't implement the clipboard method for it.)

#### Installation:

    gem install nokogiri
