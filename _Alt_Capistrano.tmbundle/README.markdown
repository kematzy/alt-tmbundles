# Capistrano.tmbundle

This is a [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) bundle for [Capistrano](http://capify.org/). It provides commands for several of the most common Capistrano operations, including deployment, rollback, migrations, and maintenance operations.

# Installation

Open a Terminal and clone the bundle from GitHub:

    cd "$HOME/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Bundles"
    git clone git://github.com/vigetlabs/capistrano-tmbundle.git Capistrano.tmbundle

If TextMate is running while you do this, you will also need to tell it to reload bundles:

    osascript -e 'tell app "TextMate" to reload bundles'
